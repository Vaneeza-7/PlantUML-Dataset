Consider an online reservation system for a bus company. The bus company
includes several buses and manage trips to different cities. Each bus is
identified by its plate number and a separately assigned bus number. The
trips are based on a predefined schedule and stop at predefined bus stations.
Each bus can have only one trip per day. Each bus includes a driver and one
hostess. For long trips, the bus will have breaks at service and rest areas.
There are two types of trips, normal trips and express trips. Express trips do
not stop at intermediate stations and get faster at the destination. Seats can
be reserved by customers on the web site of the bus company. The customer
has the option to directly pay for the seat through the website. In that case,
the seat cannot be cancelled (neither by the customer nor by the bus
company). If the customer has not paid for the seat, the bus company can
cancel the seat if the customer does not show up one hour before the trip.
When the reservation is cancelled, the seat will become free and can be sold
to another customer. Both the customer and the company staff must
authenticate themselves for performing operations with the system.
