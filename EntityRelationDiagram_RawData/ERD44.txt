The Gardening Social App is designed to create a vibrant, interactive community for gardening enthusiasts to share tips, showcase their plants, and connect with other green thumbs. The app offers features for sharing gardening progress, exchanging advice, and discovering plants and techniques, making it a digital haven for both beginner and expert gardeners.

Gardening Profile and Progress Sharing: Users create profiles showcasing their gardening interests (e.g., houseplants, vegetable gardens, succulents) and can post updates on plant growth, new additions, or gardening projects, complete with photos and progress notes.

Plant and Garden Journals: Allows users to track individual plants, log growth milestones, watering schedules, soil preferences, and health notes. This journal feature helps gardeners monitor progress and provides a timeline to share with followers.

Community Forum and Q&A: Users can ask questions, share advice, and troubleshoot plant issues in community-driven forums. Specific topic boards for various plant types, climates, or gardening techniques enable users to connect with others who share similar interests.

Plant Identification and Database: A built-in plant identification tool allows users to snap photos of unknown plants and get information about care needs, optimal growing conditions, and common issues. The database also includes details on watering, light needs, and soil types for a variety of plants.

Events and Group Projects: Local gardening groups or virtual events allow users to participate in community gardens, plant swaps, workshops, and gardening challenges. Users can join projects, learn from experts, and build community connections around shared gardening goals.

Marketplace and Tool Recommendations: The app includes a marketplace for users to buy, sell, or trade plants, seeds, and gardening tools. There are also product reviews and recommendations, making it easy to find quality tools and supplies for specific gardening needs.
