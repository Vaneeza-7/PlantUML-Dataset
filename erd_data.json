The library serves approximately 16,000 members and holds 100,000 titles with 250,000 volumes (averaging 2.5 copies per book). About 10% of the books are on loan at any time. The system ensures librarians can track book availability, including how many copies are in the library or out on loan. An online catalog organizes books by author, title, and subject area, with detailed descriptions accessible for reference. Each book is uniquely identified by its International Standard Book Number (ISBN), allowing differentiation between editions or bindings of the same title. Certain books, like rare items, maps, or reference materials, are non-lendable and tracked separately. The database also keeps a wishlist of books that librarians aim to acquire, such as rare or out-of-print editions. Members can borrow up to five books for 21 days, with a one-week grace period before reminders are sent. Faculty members, considered automatic members, have extended borrowing privileges, allowing three-month loans with a two-week grace period. Membership requires an application, including personal details like SSN, addresses, and phone numbers. Each member receives a card valid for four years, with renewal notices sent a month before expiry. Faculty member data is auto-integrated from employee records, and cards are sent to their campus address. The system also identifies active and inactive members based on borrowing behavior. It tracks top borrowers, ensuring data on borrowing trends is available. Approximately 5% of members receive reminders to return overdue books, and a similar percentage of overdue books are lost or unreturned. The database differentiates between lendable and non-lendable books, tracks borrowing history, and keeps data on books of interest for acquisition.

Student Registration and Allocation Students register for the hostel by filling out an application form that includes their student ID, name, contact details, department, year of study, and gender. Each student is assigned a room based on availability. Rooms are categorized by room number, block, floor, capacity, and type (single, double, triple occupancy). A student can occupy only one room at a time, and multiple students may share the same room if it has more than one bed. Once a room is allocated, the system stores the date of allocation and generates a room assignment ID to track the occupancy history. 2. Room Management Each room belongs to a block within the hostel (e.g., Block A, Block B). The system maintains the status of rooms, indicating whether a room is vacant, occupied, or under maintenance. There are staff members assigned to manage room maintenance requests. These staff members are identified by their staff ID, name, role, and contact information. 3. Fees and Payment Tracking Students are charged a monthly fee based on the room type they are assigned. The fee details include the amount, due date, and payment status (paid, pending, overdue). Students can make payments for the hostel fees through the system. Each payment is recorded with a payment ID, payment date, amount paid, and the method of payment (cash, card, online transfer). The system should also track any penalties for late payments and generate invoices for students. 4. Visitor Management The hostel management system allows students to register visitors. Visitors are recorded with visitor ID, name, contact details, and the date and time of their visit. A visitor must be assigned to a specific student, and their entry and exit are recorded for security purposes. 5. Complaint and Maintenance Tracking Students can file complaints regarding room maintenance or other issues through the system. Each complaint is assigned a complaint ID, description, date filed, and status (open, in progress, resolved). Maintenance staff members are assigned to resolve these complaints, and the system tracks maintenance requests, including the staff assigned, completion date, and maintenance details. 6. Reporting The system generates reports on room occupancy, student payment statuses, and maintenance requests. These reports can be filtered by block, student, or date range.",

Employees are also tracked by their date of joining, salary, and availability (active, on leave, etc.). Employees can be assigned to multiple projects at the same time, but each project requires tracking the employee’s role on the project (developer, tester, manager, etc.). 2. Client Management The system maintains details about clients who provide the company with projects. Each client has a client ID, company name, contact person, email, and phone number. Clients can have multiple projects with the software house. Each project has an associated start date, end date, budget, and status (active, completed, on hold). A client can make payments to the software house for services provided. These payments are tracked with a payment ID, payment date, amount, and payment method (bank transfer, credit card, etc.). 3. Project Management Each project is given a project ID, name, description, and deadline. The system tracks the start date and end date of each project. Each project is divided into milestones. A milestone includes a milestone ID, description, start date, end date, and status (in progress, completed). A project can be assigned multiple employees, with each employee having a specific role (developer, manager, tester, etc.) in the project. The system records the hours worked by employees on each project. The system should also track the project budget, including cost of resources, payments made by clients, and any additional expenses. 4. Task Management Projects are broken down into tasks. Each task has a task ID, description, priority (low, medium, high), assigned employee, deadline, and status (pending, in progress, completed). Employees are responsible for completing tasks, and the system records time logs for each task, showing how long it took to complete. Tasks may also have dependencies, meaning some tasks can only begin once others are completed. 5. Resource Management The software house uses various resources such as software licenses, hardware, and office supplies. Each resource has a resource ID, name, type (software, hardware), purchase date, cost, and assigned department. Resources can be allocated to employees or projects. The system should track the current status of resources (in use, available, damaged) and manage inventory levels. 6. Reporting and Monitoring The system generates reports on project progress, employee performance, and resource allocation. Reports on client payments and project financials (e.g., total expenditure vs. budget) are also generated for management to monitor the health of each project. The system can notify managers when project deadlines are approaching or when payments from clients are overdue. 7. Payroll Management The system should manage employee payroll by storing details like salary, bonus, deductions, and pay date. Employees receive monthly salaries, and the system tracks the payroll status (paid, pending) for each employee.",
