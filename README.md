# Some Considerations:

## Regarding Cardinality:
According to Craig Larman in *Applying UML and Patterns*, the common practice is to include cardinality details only when they are significant to the design. In many early analysis models, where the focus is on identifying classes and their responsibilities, the default assumption of “1” is often used, and explicit cardinalities are added later only when they add meaningful clarification to the relationships.

## Regarding Facade:
According to Craig Larman’s approach in *Applying UML and Patterns*, you typically do not include these system-level containment relationships in early analysis models. Larman recommends focusing on the responsibilities and collaborations among the domain objects rather than on how the system class holds collections of those objects. In practice:

- **Avoiding Clutter:**  
  The OnlineMovieTicketBookingSystem is often seen as a façade or controller that orchestrates use cases. Its associations with Users, Movies, Seats, Bookings, Payments, and CustomerSupport are usually implementation details that don’t add meaningful insight into the domain’s behavior. Larman suggests that including every such containment (whether by aggregation or composition) can overcomplicate the diagram.

- **Emphasis on Domain Collaborations:**  
  The analysis model should highlight the essential relationships between domain objects (for example, how a Booking is related to a Seat or a Payment) rather than showing that the system maintains collections of these objects. This keeps the focus on the business responsibilities and avoids distracting details.

- **Incremental Refinement:**  
  Larman’s method advocates starting with a simple, clear model. Only when the design requires further detail (typically during the design phase) should you introduce additional associations to capture how the system organizes or controls its objects.

In summary, while you might later add such associations for implementation or design clarity, according to Larman’s guidance these associations are not needed in the early or conceptual analysis models.

## Insight on Enhance:

- Enhancement (Optimization) should be viewed as the conversion from the second diagram (domain objects) to the first diagram (facade/controller). This is because it introduces a centralized point of interaction for enhancing the system with AI, allowing for easier integration, modification, and maintenance.

The first diagram’s facade/controller approach optimizes system architecture by making it more modular and extensible, especially when introducing complex features like AI.
