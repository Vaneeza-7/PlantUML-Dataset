This system manages the operations of a shopping mall, including tenants (shops), employees, visitors, and services provided within the mall.

1. Shop/Tenant Management
The mall houses multiple shops, each registered with shop ID, shop name, type of business (e.g., retail, food), floor number, rental amount, and lease period.
Each shop is managed by a shop owner or manager, with details such as owner name, contact information, and contract details.
The system tracks rental payments made by each shop and generates invoices for shop owners.
2. Employee Management
The system manages mall employees, including security personnel, maintenance staff, and management staff. Each employee is identified by an employee ID, name, position, shift schedule, and assigned duties.
Employees are assigned to specific zones of the mall (e.g., parking, food court, retail areas), and their attendance and performance are monitored.
3. Visitor Management
The system tracks visitors entering the mall, including visitor count per day, entry time, and exit time.
Special events or promotions may attract more visitors, and the system can help analyze visitor trends during these events.
4. Parking Management
The mall offers parking facilities for visitors. The system manages parking slots, including slot ID, floor, availability, and type (standard, VIP).
Visitors are issued parking tickets, and the system records parking fees and time spent in the parking area.
5. Event and Promotion Management
The mall hosts events, such as sales, product launches, or festivals. Each event is recorded with an event ID, event name, date, location (within the mall), and organizer details.
The system tracks promotions run by individual shops, including promotion details, duration, and participating stores.
6. Maintenance and Facility Management
The system handles maintenance requests from shops or employees, with each request assigned a request ID, description, date reported, staff assigned, and status (open, in progress, resolved).
The system also manages facility maintenance (e.g., elevators, air conditioning), ensuring they are regularly serviced and operational.
7. Financial Management
The system tracks the mallâ€™s financial operations, including rental income, maintenance costs, and utility bills (e.g., electricity, water).
It generates financial reports on mall earnings, operational expenses, and shop rental payments
