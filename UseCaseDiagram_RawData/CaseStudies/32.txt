Online learning is a part of many institutionâ€™s course offerings around the world. The scope of 
online quiz systems increased in this pandemic situation. The objective of the system is to maintain

student and teacher to gain knowledge and monitor it by the institution (admin). This system provides teachers to know about the students in remote education. The delightful features of the system 
are online teachers, remote tests, auto evaluation and feedback from students. Admin is responsible 
for the registration of both teachers and students. Teachers define the number of questions, time of 
the quiz, schedule for the quiz and they can edit it. At the end of a quiz, students can see the correct
