A Restaurant Management System streamlines operations such as table reservations, order processing, billing, inventory control, and customer service to enhance efficiency and improve the dining experience.

Table Reservations:
The system manages table availability and reservations by tracking customer details, party size, and dining time. It assigns tables automatically and accommodates walk-ins by checking real-time availability.

Order Management:
Servers input customer orders into the system, which are sent directly to the kitchen. Orders are categorized by table and updated with any modifications (e.g., allergies, extra toppings). This ensures accurate preparation and delivery.

Menu Management:
The system maintains an interactive menu with dish details, prices, and ingredients. It tracks ingredient availability, marking dishes as unavailable when stocks run out. Updates to the menu, such as new items or price changes, are handled seamlessly.

Billing and Payments:
The system calculates itemized bills, including taxes and service charges. Multiple payment methods (cash, cards, mobile payments) are supported, and bills can be split among customers if requested.

Inventory Management:
Inventory levels are tracked for ingredients and supplies, with automatic alerts for low stock. Usage tracking minimizes wastage and optimizes stock management, helping reduce food waste.

Kitchen and Waitstaff Coordination:
Orders are sent directly to the kitchen display system, updating their status in real-time (e.g., in progress, ready). This enhances communication between staff, reducing delays and errors.

Customer Profiles and Loyalty Programs:
Customer profiles store preferences, past orders, and contact details, enabling personalized service. Loyalty programs reward customers with points redeemable for discounts or exclusive offers, fostering repeat business.

Takeout and Delivery:
The system supports takeout and delivery orders, tracking them from placement to completion. Delivery times and charges are calculated automatically, with options for integrating third-party services or managing in-house delivery staff.

Reporting and Analytics:
Daily and periodic reports on sales, popular menu items, inventory usage, and customer feedback help managers make informed decisions. Employee performance is also tracked, optimizing staffing and service quality.

Customer Feedback:
Guests can provide feedback on food, service, and overall experience. The system records and analyzes this input to identify areas for improvement.

This system ensures smooth restaurant operations, efficient resource management, and improved guest satisfaction.
