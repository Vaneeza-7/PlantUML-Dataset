Job seekers work hard to gain the right skills and knowledge to give them an edge over others in the 
role they seek. However, at times, despite their best efforts, one may find it difficult to move a step 
closer to this sought-after job. Hence a platform for listing out the availability of jobs irrespective of 
the field is required. Furthermore, a job site serves a dual purpose. On one hand, it lists out the availability of jobs to candidates, and on the other, it serves as a database of registered candidateâ€™s profiles 
for companies to shortlist. The objective is to develop a software solution to predict the availability 
of jobs based on location, sectors, package, platform, interest and eligibility. As it is important to 
keep the candidates engaged during their job search, it is important to provide facets on the abovementioned criteria so that they can narrow down to the jobs of their choice.
