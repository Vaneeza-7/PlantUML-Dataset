A hotel management system streamlines operations such as room reservations, guest check-ins and check-outs, billing, housekeeping, and guest services to enhance efficiency and satisfaction.

Room Management:
The system maintains a catalog of rooms, detailing type (e.g., single, double, suite), price, amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, breakfast), and availability. It tracks room occupancy, alerts staff when rooms are ready for new guests, and ensures smooth assignment of rooms.

Reservations:
Guests can reserve rooms by selecting check-in/check-out dates and room preferences. The system generates a reservation ID and stores guest details, including contact information and special requests. Group bookings are supported, ensuring rooms are assigned nearby.

Check-In and Check-Out:
During check-in, the system verifies reservations and assigns rooms, storing details such as stay duration and billing. At check-out, it calculates the total bill for room charges and additional services (e.g., meals, laundry) and updates room status to vacant, triggering housekeeping.

Billing and Payments:
The system compiles charges for rooms and services, supporting various payment methods (e.g., cash, card). For corporate bookings, it generates group invoices or bills companies for bulk payments.

Housekeeping and Maintenance:
Housekeeping schedules are managed to clean and restock rooms after check-outs. Maintenance requests (e.g., plumbing issues) are logged and assigned to relevant teams for resolution, ensuring rooms remain operational.

Guest Services:
Guests can request services such as room service, wake-up calls, or spa appointments. The system tracks these requests and routes them to appropriate departments (e.g., housekeeping, kitchen). Dining reservations and event bookings are also managed efficiently.

Customer Profiles and Loyalty Programs:
The system stores guest profiles with details about past stays, preferences, and feedback, enabling personalized service. Loyalty programs allow guests to earn points redeemable for discounts, room upgrades, or exclusive offers.

Event and Conference Management:
For events or conferences, the system tracks space availability, manages bookings, and supports catering or equipment requests. It generates invoices for events, including room and service charges.

Reporting and Analytics:
The system provides reports on occupancy rates, revenue, service usage, and customer feedback, helping management make informed decisions about pricing and promotions. It also tracks inventory for supplies like linens and toiletries to ensure stock availability.

This system ensures efficient hotel operations, improves guest experiences, and supports better resource management.
