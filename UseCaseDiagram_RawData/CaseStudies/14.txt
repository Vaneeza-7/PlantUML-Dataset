Amidst this pandemic period, students are being educated through online education platforms on 
smartphones and other similar devices. Many underprivileged children are unable to get access 
to such devices. Also, the people who are willing to help arenâ€™t able to reach the needy due to 
lockdown. The ultimate aim of this system is to help such children by giving the collected devices 
from the people who were willing to help them. This system requests the donors to enter the details 
regarding the device they are willing to donate. It also requests the address details of the donor in 
order to reach them. On successful entry of such details, the user has to wait for the approval of 
the device. The admin has to verify the details of the device and assign it to a pickup executive for 
collection. This system also allows the volunteers to join the team. So that they could be helped by 
picking up the devices in their locality
