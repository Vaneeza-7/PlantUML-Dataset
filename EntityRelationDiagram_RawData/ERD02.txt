A UNIVERSITY database tracks student enrollments, grades, and related academic details. The system includes the following entities and relationships:

COLLEGE: Represents the universityâ€™s organizational structure. Each college has a unique name (CName), main office (COffice), phone number (CPhone), and a faculty member as the dean. Colleges administer multiple academic departments.

DEPARTMENT (DEPT): Each department has a unique name (DName), code (DCode), main office (DOffice), phone (DPhone), and a faculty member as chair, with the start date of their tenure (CStartDate). Departments offer courses and manage instructors and students.

COURSE: Departments offer courses, each with a unique name (CoName), code (CCode), level (e.g., 1 for freshman, 2 for sophomore), credit hours (Credits), and a description (CDesc).

INSTRUCTOR: Each instructor has a unique identifier (Id), name (IName), office (IOffice), phone (IPhone), and rank (Rank) and is assigned to one primary department.

STUDENT: Each student has a unique ID (Sid), name (SName: composed of FName, MName, LName), address (Addr), phone (Phone), major code (Major), and date of birth (DoB). Students belong to one primary department, and their grades are tracked for completed sections.

SECTION: Courses are offered as sections, each with a unique identifier (SecId), section number (SecNo), semester (Sem), year (Year), classroom (CRoom: building code and room number), and schedule (DaysTime). Each section is linked to one course and one instructor. Sections must have at least five students.

The system maintains many-to-many relationships between STUDENT and SECTION, with grades recorded as available. Historical and current section data are stored for reference, ensuring comprehensive academic tracking.
