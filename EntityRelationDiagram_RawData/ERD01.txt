 The company is organized into departments. Each department has a unique 
name, a unique number, and a particular employee who manages the depart
ment. We keep track of the start date when that employee began managing 
the department. A department may have several locations.
A department controls a number of projects, each of which has a unique 
name, a unique number, and a single location.
The database will store each employee’s name, Social Security number,2 
address, salary, sex (gender), and birth date. An employee is assigned to one 
department, but may work on several projects, which are not necessarily 
controlled by the same department. It is required to keep track of the cur
rent number of hours per week that an employee works on each project, as 
well as the direct supervisor of each employee (who is another employee).
The database will keep track of the dependents of each employee for insur
ance purposes, including each dependent’s first name, sex, birth date, and 
relationship to the employee.
