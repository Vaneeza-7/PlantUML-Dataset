The Stress Tracker app is a comprehensive tool for users to monitor and manage their stress in a structured and insightful way. Users can log daily stress levels, moods, and physical symptoms, as well as note potential triggers, such as work, finances, or personal relationships. By identifying these patterns over time, users gain a clearer understanding of how various factors influence their stress. The app also helps users log coping methods like exercise, mindfulness, or social activities, allowing them to see what strategies are most effective in reducing stress.

Beyond tracking, the app provides personalized recommendations based on user data, offering tools like guided breathing exercises, meditation sessions, and stress-relieving activities. Visual analytics, including graphs and trends, help users see the bigger picture of their mental well-being, showing how stress levels correlate with sleep, mood, or lifestyle changes. With goal-setting features, users can set and monitor personal wellness objectives, while reminders and notifications support consistency in tracking and using coping mechanisms. The Stress Tracker empowers users to make informed, proactive choices for their mental health, fostering resilience and encouraging healthy stress-management habits over time.
