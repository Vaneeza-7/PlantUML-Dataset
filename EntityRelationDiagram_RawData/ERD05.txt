Consider a MAIL_ORDER database in which employees take orders for parts 
from customers. The data requirements are summarized as follows:
 ■The mail order company has employees, each identified by a unique em
ployee number, first and last name, and Zip Code.
 ■ Each customer of the company is identified by a unique customer number, 
f
 irst and last name, and Zip Code.
 ■ Each part sold by the company is identified by a unique part number, a 
part name, price, and quantity in stock.
 ■ Each order placed by a customer is taken by an employee and is given a 
unique order number. Each order contains specified quantities of one or 
more parts. Each order has a date of receipt as well as an expected ship 
date. The actual ship date is also recorded.
