The hostel management system is designed to manage the allocation of rooms, track payments, and maintain information on both students and staff.

1. Student Registration and Allocation
Students register for the hostel by filling out an application form that includes their student ID, name, contact details, department, year of study, and gender.
Each student is assigned a room based on availability. Rooms are categorized by room number, block, floor, capacity, and type (single, double, triple occupancy).
A student can occupy only one room at a time, and multiple students may share the same room if it has more than one bed.
Once a room is allocated, the system stores the date of allocation and generates a room assignment ID to track the occupancy history.
2. Room Management
Each room belongs to a block within the hostel (e.g., Block A, Block B).
The system maintains the status of rooms, indicating whether a room is vacant, occupied, or under maintenance.
There are staff members assigned to manage room maintenance requests. These staff members are identified by their staff ID, name, role, and contact information.
3. Fees and Payment Tracking
Students are charged a monthly fee based on the room type they are assigned. The fee details include the amount, due date, and payment status (paid, pending, overdue).
Students can make payments for the hostel fees through the system. Each payment is recorded with a payment ID, payment date, amount paid, and the method of payment (cash, card, online transfer).
The system should also track any penalties for late payments and generate invoices for students.
4. Visitor Management
The hostel management system allows students to register visitors. Visitors are recorded with visitor ID, name, contact details, and the date and time of their visit.
A visitor must be assigned to a specific student, and their entry and exit are recorded for security purposes.
5. Complaint and Maintenance Tracking
Students can file complaints regarding room maintenance or other issues through the system. Each complaint is assigned a complaint ID, description, date filed, and status (open, in progress, resolved).
Maintenance staff members are assigned to resolve these complaints, and the system tracks maintenance requests, including the staff assigned, completion date, and maintenance details.
6. Reporting
The system generates reports on room occupancy, student payment statuses, and maintenance requests. These reports can be filtered by block, student, or date range.
