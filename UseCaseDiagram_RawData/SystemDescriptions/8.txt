The Gym Management System is a centralized software solution designed to streamline gym operations by integrating member management, class scheduling, attendance tracking, payments, and inventory management. It allows gym administrators to manage member registrations, class schedules, and payments, while enabling trainers to access class assignments and track attendance. The system also facilitates communication between members and staff, supports automated payment processing, and ensures real-time updates on inventory. Biometric or card-based attendance tracking and seamless communication tools enhance overall operational efficiency.
