Rules and regulations are paramount to all aspects of life. Certain proponents have asserted that 
crime which is a violation against laws of the society, is integral to the human nature and hence 
the society can never be completely free from it. In the existing system, all work is done on papers, 
so it is very difficult to secure crime reports data. This system needs more manpower to track the 
records of crimes and it lacks security. Modern society is characterized by increasing levels of risk 
posed by internal and external security threats. This poses the importance to develop an automated crime management system to keep a record of the crime and the criminals involved. The 
proposed crime bureau is a database system in which the police keeps the record of criminals who 
have been arrested, to be arrested, or escaped and the complaints. This will help the police department in enhanced management of information. The main entities in the whole process include; 
the petitioner (the person who files a First Incident Report (FIR)), victim, accused or criminal, 
case and investigating officer. The proposed crime record management system can overcome all 
the limitations of the existing system. This system provides proper security and reduces the manual work. This project helps to maintain a database through which the entire crime activities in 
the state can be monitored.
