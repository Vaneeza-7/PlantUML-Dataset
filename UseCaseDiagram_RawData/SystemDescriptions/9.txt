The Time Table Generating Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to automate the creation and management of timetables in educational institutions. By utilizing intelligent algorithms, the system optimizes resource allocation, minimizes scheduling conflicts, and enhances productivity. The System allows administrators to enroll students, allocate courses to both students and faculty, and generate optimized timetables. Faculty members can input time preferences, while students can view their course schedules. The system also automatically allocates lecture halls and generates reports for both students and faculty, detailing their assigned courses and schedules.
