A Restaurant Management System is designed to handle various operations, including table reservations, order management, billing, inventory control, and customer service. The system ensures efficient management of the dining experience, both for customers and the restaurant staff.

Key Features:
Table Reservations:

The system manages table availability by tracking reservations. Customers can book a table by providing their name, contact information, and reservation time.
The system automatically assigns available tables based on party size and desired dining time. It can also handle walk-in guests, checking for available tables in real time.
Order Management:

The system allows servers to input customer orders into the system, which are then automatically sent to the kitchen display or printer.
It categorizes orders by table number, ensuring that the right items are delivered to the correct guests. The system tracks modifications to orders (e.g., extra toppings, allergies) and ensures that the kitchen staff are updated accordingly.
Menu Management:

The system maintains an interactive menu, displaying all available dishes with their prices, descriptions, and ingredients. The menu is easily updated when new dishes are added or prices change.
It tracks the availability of ingredients, automatically marking items as unavailable when certain ingredients are out of stock.
Billing and Payments:

After the meal, the system calculates the total bill for each table, including taxes and any service charges. The bill is itemized to show each ordered dish and drink.
The system supports multiple payment methods, such as cash, credit/debit cards, and mobile payments. It can split bills if customers request separate payments for shared orders.
Inventory Management:

The system tracks inventory levels for all ingredients and supplies used in the kitchen. When stocks run low, it automatically notifies management to reorder items.
It also helps manage wastage by tracking how much of each ingredient is used, helping the restaurant optimize stock usage and reduce food waste.
Kitchen and Waitstaff Coordination:

The system ensures smooth communication between the waitstaff and kitchen. When an order is placed, it is sent directly to the kitchen, where it appears on the kitchenâ€™s display system or printed tickets.
Order statuses (e.g., in progress, ready) are updated in real-time, notifying the waitstaff when food is ready to be served. This reduces miscommunication and delays in service.
Customer Profiles and Loyalty Programs:

The system stores customer profiles that include details about their dining preferences, past orders, and contact information. This allows the restaurant to offer personalized service and targeted promotions.
It can also manage loyalty programs, where customers earn points for every meal or visit, redeemable for discounts, free items, or exclusive offers.
Takeout and Delivery:

The system allows customers to place takeout or delivery orders, tracking the order from placement to completion. The system calculates the delivery charges and estimated delivery time based on the customer's location.
It integrates with delivery services or manages in-house delivery staff, ensuring that food is delivered fresh and on time.
Reporting and Analytics:

The system generates reports on daily sales, popular menu items, customer feedback, and inventory usage. These reports help restaurant managers make informed decisions about menu changes, pricing, and inventory management.
It also tracks employee performance, such as how many tables each server handles and customer satisfaction with their service, helping management optimize staffing and service quality.
Customer Feedback:

The system allows customers to provide feedback on their dining experience. This information is recorded and analyzed to identify areas for improvement, such as service speed, food quality, or menu variety.
