A hotel management system is designed to handle various operations such as room reservations, guest check-ins and check-outs, billing, housekeeping, and customer service, ensuring smooth operations and guest satisfaction.

Key Features
Room Management

The system maintains a catalog of rooms, including details such as room type (e.g., single, double, suite), price per night, amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, breakfast, view), and occupancy status.
It tracks room availability, ensuring that guests are only assigned available rooms. It also alerts the hotel staff when rooms are ready for new guests after being vacated and cleaned.
Reservations

Guests can make reservations by selecting their desired check-in and check-out dates and choosing an available room. The system generates a reservation ID and stores guest details such as name, contact information, and any special requests (e.g., extra bed, late check-out).
For group bookings, the system can assign multiple rooms under a single reservation, ensuring that rooms are close to each other if needed.
Check-In and Check-Out

At check-in, the system verifies the guest’s reservation and assigns the room. The guest’s details, such as ID information, stay duration, and billing details, are stored in the system.
At check-out, the system calculates the guest’s total bill, including room charges and any additional services (e.g., meals, minibar, laundry). It updates the room’s status to vacant and triggers housekeeping for cleaning.
Billing and Payments

The system handles billing for room charges and other services such as room service, restaurant meals, spa treatments, or laundry. The bill is compiled at the end of the stay, and the system supports multiple payment methods (e.g., cash, card).
In the case of corporate bookings, the system can generate group invoices or issue bills to the respective companies for bulk payments.
Housekeeping and Maintenance

The system schedules housekeeping to ensure rooms are cleaned and restocked with necessary supplies after a guest checks out. It tracks the status of each room (e.g., vacant, occupied, under maintenance).
For any maintenance requests (e.g., faulty air conditioning, plumbing issues), the system logs the request and assigns it to the appropriate maintenance team for resolution.
Guest Services

Guests can request additional services such as room service, extra towels, or wake-up calls through the system. These requests are routed to the appropriate hotel departments (e.g., kitchen, housekeeping).
The system also manages spa appointments, dining reservations, and event bookings for guests, ensuring that all guest activities are tracked and recorded.
Customer Profiles and Loyalty Programs

The system stores customer profiles with information about previous stays, preferences (e.g., room type, favorite services), and feedback. This helps the hotel staff provide personalized service and improve guest satisfaction.
The system can also manage loyalty programs, allowing guests to earn points for each stay, which can be redeemed for discounts, room upgrades, or exclusive offers in future bookings.
Event and Conference Management

For hotels that host events or conferences, the system tracks event space availability, manages bookings, and allows for special arrangements like catering, seating, and audio-visual equipment.
It generates invoices for events, including room charges, equipment rental, and catering costs.
Reporting and Analytics

The system generates daily and periodic reports on room occupancy rates, revenue, service usage, and customer feedback. These reports help the hotel management make decisions about pricing, promotions, and resource allocation.
It also tracks inventory for supplies like linens, toiletries, and minibar items, ensuring that the hotel is always stocked to meet guest needs.
