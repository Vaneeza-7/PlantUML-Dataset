The Prime Minister of India has announced a new scheme of National Health ID on August 15, 
2020. According to this proposal, every Indian will get a unique Health ID based on their mobile 
number or Aadhaar number. The National Health ID will be a repository of all health-related 
information of a person. According to the National Health Authority (NHA), every patient who 
wishes to have their health records available digitally must start by creating a Health ID. Each 
Health ID will be linked to a health data consent manager – such as the National Digital Health 
Mission (NDHM) which will be used to seek the patient’s consent and allow for seamless flow 
of health information from the Personal Health Records module. This Health ID prevents various insurance frauds committed by several health agencies, hospitals including both doctors 
and patients. This will reduce the paper works and help patients easily maintain their health 
records. It can be used for further diagnosis. Children who are born after the implementation 
of the National Health ID will have all their medications recorded including the vaccines, etc.
