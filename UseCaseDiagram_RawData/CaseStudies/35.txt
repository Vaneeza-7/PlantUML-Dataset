The policies and guidelines for startups vary from state to state. Also, startups related to a particular domain are emphasized in particular areas. The people with the startups ideas at different 
levels of implementation have to approach different firms or individuals for investment who are in 
their nearest business circles, if not in the same state. All of these will adversely impact the opportunities for the startups. Startup meet is a platform for people to privately approach firms or angel 
investors with their ideas implemented at different levels for funding and mentorship. Also, the 
government policies and loan schemes of different states can be known and applied. If people are 
interested in the idea a virtual presentation can be given about it to them. There will be profiles for 
investors and entrepreneurs (people with startup ideas) where they will be describing about what 
they are looking for. The entrepreneur has to request investors or mentors from different states for 
submitting his ideas. Once accepted he can send an abstract about it. If the investors like it, they 
can call for a presentation of it. The mentors also can give mentorship. The government loans and 
policies can be viewed and also be applied through the portal. So, startup meet is a comprehensive 
platform for people who are into startups
