To provide an online platform to manage the buying, selling and storage of artistic creations provided by creators/other platforms or auctions and to organize events to exhibit these products. The 
system is a gallery having art pieces with its description, price and other information and the order 
activity, payment activity, order update activity and so on. The objective is to provide an online platform through which museums and art galleries can make use-off to exhibit their collections in times 
of unavailable street galleries. Like in times of pandemic also people need not bother not going to a 
museum or art gallery instead they can have online art shopping and art exhibits. The system should 
be immune to any chances of misuse and unauthorized reproduction of works of arts and designs. 
There will be two types of users accessing the system: Admin (Creators/authority of the art displayed) 
and Customer (One who looks to buy the art). The main features provided for the admin are that 
they will be able to update, add, delete, input price, description and information about an art (stock 
availability), generate report of gallery and that for the customers are that they will be able to order 
(Payment), delete order, view end-user projected art particulars
