Coronavirus pandemic is spreading in large numbers. Experts suggest that social distancing has 
been used for a long time as one of the methods to reduce the spike in diseases and infectious illnesses. In India alone, the cases have sharply spiked up in the past two weeks, which has led to 
imposing even tougher measures. By identifying ‘hotspots’, necessary mapping can help deal with 
the problem of community transmission, i.e., when cases start
Spreading within the population in such a way that people don’t know how they were exposed 
to the contagion. This is known as ‘Stage 3’ of an outbreak. The Aarogya Setu app, which is a 
coronavirus tracker of sorts works on the basis of contact tracing and can help a user identify possible coronavirus ‘hotspot’ around his or her area. It can help people stay safe and adopt necessary 
precautions in some areas where there are cases and accordingly, help stop or prevent community 
transmission to an extent. On the basis of geotagging, it can also alert a specific user about their 
proximity to a nearby infection case or hotspot. The app also helps users self-identify their risk and 
monitor their health assessment, considering the times when it can get difficult (and most of all, is 
not particularly safe to step out and visit health clinics).
Aarogya Setu app also helps people identify the symptoms, alert them about the best safety 
precautions and other relevant information concerning the spread of COVID-19. While this is a 
noble initiative, the app also lists down basic quarantine measures for those who are considered to 
be in the ‘high-risk’ category. It can also help people, who have had a travel history self-quarantine 
and prevent any risk of transmission.
