Mega Associates is an evolving architectural firm that is facing a fierce competition. The competitors have a modern, well-built website that is pulling some of the firm’s clients towards themselves. 
In order to avoid a situation like this and to retain all the firm’s clients and to attract new ones, 
a refreshing website is needed. The website of the firm should include the major projects of the 
firm, a brief on all the available departments and collaborations, recent news with respect to the 
firm, the firm’s insights, the history of the firm, mail or chat feature, and career opportunities with 
regard to the firm
