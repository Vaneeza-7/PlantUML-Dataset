A Designing Tool System is a software platform that enables users to create and edit designs, whether for graphic design, web design, or user interface creation. The system provides a range of tools, templates, and features that allow users to design visually appealing content with ease, supporting multiple design formats, collaborations, and version management.

Key Features:
User Accounts and Project Management:

Users create accounts to manage their design projects. Each project can include multiple designs, and the system tracks project details such as name, creation date, and status (in progress, completed).
Users can organize projects into folders or categories, allowing them to keep track of different types of designs, such as logos, web layouts, or marketing materials.
Design Canvas and Tools:

The system provides a canvas where users can create and manipulate shapes, text, images, and vectors. It supports various tools for drawing, editing, resizing, and rotating design elements.
A toolbox includes essential functions like pen tools, brushes, color pickers, layers, and text formatting options. Users can also apply filters, gradients, and transparency effects to enhance their designs.
Templates and Pre-Designed Elements:

To assist users, the system offers a wide variety of pre-built templates for common design types such as social media posts, flyers, business cards, website mockups, and presentation slides.
Users can also access stock images, icons, and pre-designed vector elements to integrate into their designs. These elements can be customized to fit their specific needs.
Collaboration and Sharing:

The system allows multiple users to work on the same design project simultaneously, facilitating collaboration. Team members can leave comments, suggest edits, and track changes in real time.
Users can share their designs via links or email invitations, giving others the ability to view or edit the project based on assigned permissions (e.g., view-only or editor access).
Version Control and Autosave:

The system automatically saves version histories of each design, allowing users to revert to previous versions if needed. This ensures that no progress is lost, and users can experiment with new ideas without fear of permanently altering their designs.
An autosave feature regularly saves changes made to the design to prevent data loss in case of unexpected disruptions.
Exporting and File Formats:

Once a design is completed, users can export their work in various file formats such as PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, or PSD. The system allows users to adjust file quality, resolution, and dimensions before exporting.
Designs can also be exported in print-ready formats for high-quality physical output or optimized for web and mobile use.
Design Libraries and Reusable Assets:

Users can create design libraries where they store commonly used elements, such as logos, brand colors, or font styles, to maintain consistency across multiple projects.
The system allows users to reuse these assets in different projects, streamlining the design process and ensuring that brand guidelines are followed.
Collaboration with External Tools:

The designing tool integrates with other third-party tools such as cloud storage platforms (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox), enabling users to import/export files seamlessly.
Integration with design review platforms allows external stakeholders to provide feedback or approve designs before finalization.
Customization and Extensions:

Users can customize their workspace layout, adjusting panels and toolbars to fit their workflow. The system offers different theme options to create a comfortable working environment.
Additionally, the system supports extensions and plugins for advanced users who need additional functionalities, such as 3D modeling tools, animation features, or code export for web designs.
Design Analytics and Feedback:

The system provides analytics that track how many times a design has been shared, viewed, or downloaded. This helps designers assess the popularity and engagement of their work.
Users can gather feedback from clients or collaborators, using tools like polls or rating systems, allowing them to improve designs based on input from others.
