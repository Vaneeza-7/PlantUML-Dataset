This system manages final year projects for university students, covering all phases from proposal submission to final evaluation. It tracks students, faculty, projects, committees, and evaluations to streamline the process.

Student and Project Management:
Students can submit project proposals individually or in groups, with each group having 2-4 members. The system tracks student details such as ID, name, email, and department, as well as group information like group ID and leader. Proposals include details such as proposal ID, title, description, submission date, and status. Projects are managed with attributes like project ID, title, description, start and end dates, and status (ongoing, completed, or rejected). Projects are supervised by faculty members or external mentors, whose roles and details are recorded.

Committee and Evaluation Management:
Each project evaluation committee, identified by a committee ID, comprises faculty members with assigned roles (chairperson, evaluator, observer). Committees evaluate projects and provide feedback or request changes. Evaluations include progress reports and final assessments, tracking report submissions, feedback, and scores. Final evaluations break scores into components like innovation, technical accuracy, and presentation.

Milestone and Task Management:
Projects are divided into milestones, each with a milestone ID, name, due date, and status. Tasks under each milestone are assigned to group members and monitored for progress. Supervisors manage tasks and milestones, ensuring timely completion.

Document Management and Reporting:
Students upload project-related documents (e.g., proposals, reports, code), tagged with document ID, title, and type. Resource requirements like software, hardware, and budgets are tracked. The system generates reports on project progress, student performance, and evaluations. Alerts notify students and supervisors of approaching deadlines.

Grading and Results:
Committees assign grades after final evaluations, stored with evaluation ID, total score, and grade breakdowns. The system tracks grade histories, helping supervisors analyze student performance trends. This streamlined approach ensures efficient project management and evaluation.
