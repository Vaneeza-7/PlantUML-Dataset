Cricket Stadium Management System:
1. The system allows fans to access comprehensive information about upcoming events in the stadium, including match schedules, team line-ups, and other relevant details.
2. Fans can explore different pricing plans for tickets, view seat availability, and securely purchase tickets for their desired events through the system.
3. The system provides a platform for sponsors to explore available sponsorship options within the stadium, enabling them to contribute to the operations and engage with the cricket community.
4. Sponsors can track the return on investment (ROI) for their sponsorships through the system, allowing them to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of their contributions.
