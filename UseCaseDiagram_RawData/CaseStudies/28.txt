In India, 1 out of 4 farmers own a smartphone. But they don’t use it optimally for insights on 
farming based on real-time data – such as weather, soil conditions, market conditions, labour 
availability etcetera, which can allow them to make data-driven decisions to get the best possible 
results. Current technologies that solve such issues are either paid services or inaccurate. They also 
tend to be more complex making it really hard for anyone to understand and interpret. An application if developed should primarily aim at reducing the risks, reducing the costs, improving yield, 
and most importantly, easy for anyone to interpret
