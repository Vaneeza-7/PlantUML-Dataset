The Virtual Health and Fitness Coach Database is structured to support a range of personalized health and fitness services, focusing on user data management, workout and nutrition plans, goal tracking, and session records. The database design enables tailored fitness plans and dynamic tracking of user progress to promote health improvement and maintain engagement over time.

The Users table is central to the system, storing personal details like age, weight, fitness goals, and activity preferences. This data allows the app to tailor recommendations for each user. Linked to this table are Health Metrics tables, which record ongoing data points such as weight, body measurements, and workout stats. By consistently tracking these metrics, the system can assess changes over time, allowing users and virtual coaches to evaluate progress and adjust plans as needed.

To facilitate customized workout routines, the database includes a Workouts table and a Workout Plans table. The Workouts table catalogs individual exercises, including attributes like exercise type, difficulty level, and instructional details. The Workout Plans table links multiple exercises to create cohesive workout sessions tailored to each user's fitness level and goals. By tracking each workout completed through a User Workout Logs table, the app can provide feedback on user adherence and highlight areas for improvement.

Nutrition management is handled through Meal Plans and Nutrition Logs tables. The Meal Plans table contains meal recommendations with nutritional breakdowns, allowing users to select meal options based on dietary preferences and calorie goals. The Nutrition Logs track user food intake, capturing calories and macronutrients consumed. By combining insights from both workout and nutrition data, the database supports a comprehensive, data-driven approach to health and fitness, helping users reach their goals while maintaining a balanced lifestyle.
