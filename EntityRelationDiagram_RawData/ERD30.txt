The Furniture Store Management System supports in-store operations such as product inventory, sales transactions, customer orders, and logistics management. It enables smooth interactions between sales staff and customers, tracks orders, and manages deliveries for store purchases.

Key Features:
Product Inventory and Display:

Sales representatives use the system to check real-time stock availability of furniture displayed in the store. Items include product ID, name, type, dimensions, material, color, price, and location in-store or warehouse.
The system allows employees to reserve items for customers if they decide to purchase later.
Sales Transactions:

In-store purchases are processed through a point-of-sale (POS) system. Once a customer selects an item, the system logs the sale with details such as product purchased, quantity, total price, and payment method (cash, credit, debit).
Receipts are generated, and the system updates inventory levels automatically upon completion of the sale.
Custom Orders:

The system supports custom furniture orders, where customers can specify preferred materials, colors, or sizes. Sales staff input these details, and the system provides a price estimate and production timeline.
Custom orders are tracked through the system, which updates customers on the progress and expected delivery date.
Delivery Scheduling and Logistics:

For large or bulk purchases, the system schedules home deliveries. Sales staff arrange delivery based on customer preference, stock availability, and logistics capacity.
The system tracks delivery vehicles, ensuring efficient route planning and timely delivery. Customers receive notifications of their scheduled delivery.
Customer Profiles and Loyalty Programs:

The system allows the creation of customer profiles, storing purchase history, preferences, and contact information.
Loyalty programs are integrated, where customers earn points with each purchase. These points can be redeemed for discounts or special promotions during future purchases.
Refunds and Exchanges:

The system handles refunds or exchanges for in-store purchases. When a customer returns an item, the system updates inventory and issues a refund based on the store's return policy.
For exchanges, the system checks if replacement items are in stock or arranges an order if necessary.
Reports and Sales Analysis:

The system generates daily reports on sales performance, in-store best-sellers, and inventory turnover. This helps management track store revenue, customer traffic, and identify popular product categories for in-store promotions.
