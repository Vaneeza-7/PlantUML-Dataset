It includes tracking and treating COVID-19 patients and monitoring the spread of the virus. It aims to assist healthcare organizations and governments to assess patient risk profiles and provide awareness to common people by connecting them with virtual care capabilities. With the current epidemiological situation of COVID-19, there is a high demand to reduce contact between persons and digitize the whole process. This will effectively reduce the infection rate, help the common people and empower medical professionals across the world to help more patients through telemedicine and virtual care.",

This considerably increases the risk of malfunctioning of major parts of a car such as the braking system and engine which lead to accidents. Car Care is a multi-brand car service and maintenance application that maintains the date at which the specific part of a car is installed and notifies the expiry date of the parts of the car for both the driver and authorized service centre, so that the car can be serviced. This application enables car owners and service centres to separately login and enter their cars information. After issuing the car, the service centre employee enters the estimated expiry dates of parts of the car in this app. This application notifies the car owners and service centres when the expiry date for parts of the car is reached. Then the service centre employee contacts the owner of a car about service, once the owner accepts service request, the service centre employee picks up the car from home, this saves the time for owner of car. And then service centre employee examines the entire car and prepares the list of the damaged parts of the car and send it to the owner of the car through this app, once the owner selects the damaged parts to be serviced, the employee services the owner selected parts and updates the information about changed parts in the app so that the car can be service again on the expiry date of changed parts. Thus, this application helps in exchanging information between car owners and service centres. This application also enables the online payment for the services.",

        "input": "Public Distribution System (PDS) is an Indian food security system. It is established by the Government of India under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution and managed jointly with state governments in India. The traditional PDS is used to distribute grocery items to India’s poor who are valid ration cardholders. The validity and the allocation of the ration cards are monitored by the state governments. A ration cardholder should be given 35 kg of food grain as per the norms of PDS. However, there are concerns about the efficiency of the distribution process. In order to make it efficient and improve the current system of PDS, we are implementing e-Ration Shop. Here, we are going to make a website for shopping purposes. Using this website ration cardholder can order his/her grocery items from the PDS online. The main reason for using this website is to make this process computerized and to remove the drawbacks of the present way of issuing products based on the ration card. The main drawback in the current system is that the PDS has been criticized for its urban bias and its failure to serve the poorer sections of the population effectively. Also, many retail shopkeepers have a large number of bogus cards to sell food grains in the open market. Many PDS dealers resort to malpractice since they acquire less Salary so, by this project we are solving this problem too. Most of the time, users do not get their rightful entitlement in terms of quantity. What’s meant for them or the farm produce procured by the PDS is diverted to the open market. So in order to avoid all these drawbacks, we are going to use the e-Ration Shop which will help us to avoid the corruption in PDS if not eradicate it. The various importance of the proposed case study is every shop’s geo-location will be located on the map, all the information regarding shop and shopkeeper respective to the ration card and region, shop opening and closing details will be available, stock provided based on category, retailers can add, edit, delete and update their shop’s other items also, retailers can advertise their shops, stock availability will be notified on regular basis, product delivery feature, complaint forum for complaints by users, easy payment system by PayTM, COD etc., admin and moderator features for government and shopkeepers and authentication system by Aadhaar number and One-Time Pin (OTP).
