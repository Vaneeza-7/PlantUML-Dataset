This considerably increases the risk of malfunctioning of major parts of a car such as the braking system and engine which lead to accidents. Car Care is a multi-brand car service and maintenance application that maintains the date at which the specific part of a car is installed and notifies the expiry date of the parts of the car for both the driver and authorized service centre, so that the car can be serviced. This application enables car owners and service centres to separately login and enter their cars information. After issuing the car, the service centre employee enters the estimated expiry dates of parts of the car in this app. This application notifies the car owners and service centres when the expiry date for parts of the car is reached. Then the service centre employee contacts the owner of a car about service, once the owner accepts service request, the service centre employee picks up the car from home, this saves the time for owner of car. And then service centre employee examines the entire car and prepares the list of the damaged parts of the car and send it to the owner of the car through this app, once the owner selects the damaged parts to be serviced, the employee services the owner selected parts and updates the information about changed parts in the app so that the car can be service again on the expiry date of changed parts.

        "input": "Public Distribution System (PDS) is an Indian food security system. It is established by the Government of India under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution and managed jointly with state governments in India. The traditional PDS is used to distribute grocery items to India’s poor who are valid ration cardholders. The validity and the allocation of the ration cards are monitored by the state governments. A ration cardholder should be given 35 kg of food grain as per the norms of PDS. However, there are concerns about the efficiency of the distribution process. In order to make it efficient and improve the current system of PDS, we are implementing e-Ration Shop. Here, we are going to make a website for shopping purposes. Using this website ration cardholder can order his/her grocery items from the PDS online. The main reason for using this website is to make this process computerized and to remove the drawbacks of the present way of issuing products based on the ration card. The main drawback in the current system is that the PDS has been criticized for its urban bias and its failure to serve the poorer sections of the population effectively. Also, many retail shopkeepers have a large number of bogus cards to sell food grains in the open market. Many PDS dealers resort to malpractice since they acquire less Salary so, by this project we are solving this problem too. Most of the time, users do not get their rightful entitlement in terms of quantity. What’s meant for them or the farm produce procured by the PDS is diverted to the open market. So in order to avoid all these drawbacks, we are going to use the e-Ration Shop which will help us to avoid the corruption in PDS if not eradicate it. The various importance of the proposed case study is every shop’s geo-location will be located on the map, all the information regarding shop and shopkeeper respective to the ration card and region, shop opening and closing details will be available, stock provided based on category, retailers can add, edit, delete and update their shop’s other items also, retailers can advertise their shops, stock availability will be notified on regular basis, product delivery feature, complaint forum for complaints by users, easy payment system by PayTM, COD etc., admin and moderator features for government and shopkeepers and authentication system by Aadhaar number and One-Time Pin (OTP).

The National Health ID will be a repository of all health-related information of a person. According to the National Health Authority (NHA), every patient who wishes to have their health records available digitally must start by creating a Health ID. Each Health ID will be linked to a health data consent manager – such as the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) which will be used to seek the patient’s consent and allow for seamless flow of health information from the Personal Health Records module. This Health ID prevents various insurance frauds committed by several health agencies, hospitals including both doctors and patients. This will reduce the paper works and help patients easily maintain their health records. It can be used for further diagnosis. Children who are born after the implementation of the National Health ID will have all their medications recorded including the vaccines, etc.",

However, paperback college magazines narrow the scope for a more extensive audience and are lavish of important resources like paper, especially when the magazines are printed seasonally on campus year after year. Consequently, many students may not be able to make it to the print media of the college. To subdue these shortcomings, an online college magazine system can be developed. This system will enable students of the college to liberally generate content for and about the college. Anyone in any part of the world can read and rate articles being published in the online magazine. Resource usage is much more minimal, but the experience is as efficient as in paperback magazines. With the help of this software, they will be able to read, write, draft, edit and publish all forms of content like articles, essays, op-eds, photography, poetry, etc. Selected students and faculty can regularly write and post articles for the magazine. Contributors (like alumni) can write for the magazine occasionally. Guests or readers can read, comment on and rate articles. Guests can also act as contributors if interested. Moderators will review articles before publishing to decide the pertinence of content. Articles will be organized based on categories appropriate to the workflow of the college. Thus, the implementation of this system will benefit all members of the college by providing consistent campus-related news and also by improving the literary and technical insight of faculty and students who write for the magazine.",

In the existing system, all work is done on papers, so it is very difficult to secure crime reports data. This system needs more manpower to track the records of crimes and it lacks security. Modern society is characterized by increasing levels of risk posed by internal and external security threats. This poses the importance to develop an automated crime management system to keep a record of the crime and the criminals involved. The proposed crime bureau is a database system in which the police keeps the record of criminals who have been arrested, to be arrested, or escaped and the complaints. This will help the police department in enhanced management of information. The main entities in the whole process include; the petitioner (the person who files a First Incident Report (FIR)), victim, accused or criminal, case and investigating officer. The proposed crime record management system can overcome all the limitations of the existing system. This system provides proper security and reduces the manual work.

Experts suggest that social distancing has been used for a long time as one of the methods to reduce the spike in diseases and infectious illnesses. In India alone, the cases have sharply spiked up in the past two weeks, which has led to imposing even tougher measures. By identifying ‘hotspots’, necessary mapping can help deal with the problem of community transmission, i.e., when cases start spreading within the population in such a way that people don’t know how they were exposed to the contagion. This is known as ‘Stage 3’ of an outbreak. The Aarogya Setu app, which is a coronavirus tracker of sorts works on the basis of contact tracing and can help a user identify possible coronavirus ‘hotspot’ around his or her area. It can help people stay safe and adopt necessary precautions in some areas where there are cases and accordingly, help stop or prevent community transmission to an extent. On the basis of geotagging, it can also alert a specific user about their proximity to a nearby infection case or hotspot. The app also helps users self-identify their risk and monitor their health assessment, considering the times when it can get difficult (and most of all, is not particularly safe to step out and visit health clinics). Aarogya Setu app also helps people identify the symptoms, alert them about the best safety precautions and other relevant information concerning the spread of COVID-19. While this is a noble initiative, the app also lists down basic quarantine measures for those who are considered to be in the ‘high-risk’ category.
