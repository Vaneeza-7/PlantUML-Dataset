Maintaining the authentic documents physically in a single location is considered to be a challenging task. Thus, digitizing documents enables centralized storage of all the physical documents, enabling easy retrieval from anywhere at any time. It also prevents the troubles caused by missing any of those physical certificates. This can be achieved through the DigiDocLocker which is a platform for issuance and verification of documents and certificates in a digital format, thereby eliminating the use of physical documents. DigiDocLocker aims at benefiting all the citizens of the country by providing access to authentic documents/certificates such as driving licence, vehicle registration, and academic mark sheets in digital format from the original issuers of these certificates. DigiDocLocker has the following functionalities:
i. A Registration module allows the users to register and a Login module that allows the authorized users.
ii. An Upload Document module allows the users to upload documents such as driving licence, vehicle registration, academic mark sheet, and other relevant documents in various file formats.
iii. A Profile module displays the complete profile of the user as available in the database.
iv. An Issuer module displays the certificate issuers’ names and the number of documents issued to the user by the issuer. For example, the Income Tax Department, Government of India has provided PAN Verification Records to Indian citizens via DigiLocker.
v. A Requester module displays the requesters’ names and the number of documents requested from the user by the requesters. For example, citizens applying through Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)'s Online Recruitment Application (ORA) can upload documents through DigiDocLocker as well.
