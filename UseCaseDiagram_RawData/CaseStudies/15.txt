College magazines provide an authoritative, recognizable and artistic platform of expression to 
the student body. However, paperback college magazines narrow the scope for a more extensive 
audience and are lavish of important resources like paper, especially when the magazines are 
printed seasonally on campus year after year. Consequently, many students may not be able to 
make it to the print media of the college. To subdue these shortcomings, an online college magazine system can be developed. This system will enable students of the college to liberally generate content for and about the college. Anyone in any part of the world can read and rate articles 
being published in the online magazine. Resource usage is much more minimal, but the experience is as efficient as in paperback magazines. With the help of this software, they will be able to 
read, write, draft, edit and publish all forms of content like articles, essays, op-eds, photography, 
poetry, etc. Selected students and faculty can regularly write and post articles for the magazine. 
Contributors (like alumni) can write for the magazine occasionally. Guests or readers can read, 
comment on and rate articles. Guests can also act as contributors if interested. Moderators will 
review articles before publishing to decide the pertinence of content. Articles will be organized 
based on categories appropriate to the workflow of the college. Thus, the implementation of this 
system will benefit all members of the college by providing consistent campus-related news and 
also by improving the literary and technical insight of faculty and students who write for the 
magazine.
