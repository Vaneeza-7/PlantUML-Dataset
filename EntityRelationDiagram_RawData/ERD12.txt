1. The game of chess is played between two players.
 2. The game is played on an 8 × 8 board
 3. The players are assigned a color of black or white at the start of the game.
 4. Each player starts with the following pieces (traditionally called 
chessmen):
 f. 
a. king
 b. queen
 c. 2 rooks
 d. 2 bishops
 e. 2 knights
 8 pawns
 5. Every piece has its own initial position.
 6. Every piece has its own set of legal moves based on the state of the game. 
You do not need to worry about which moves are or are not legal except 
for the following issues:
 a. A piece may move to an empty square or capture an opposing piece.
 b. If a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.
 c. If a pawn moves to the last row, it is “promoted” by converting it to 
another piece (queen, rook, bishop, or knight).
