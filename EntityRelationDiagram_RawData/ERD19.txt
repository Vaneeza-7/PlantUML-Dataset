The system is designed to manage both students and faculty, along with their associated academic activities and roles within the institution.

1. Student Management
The system stores student information, including student ID, name, email, contact details, department, program, and year of study.
Each student is enrolled in multiple courses. The system tracks course enrollments, grades, and attendance.
Students are assigned advisors (faculty members) to guide them throughout their academic journey.
2. Faculty Management
Faculty members have a faculty ID, name, email, department, designation (professor, lecturer), and courses taught.
Faculty members are responsible for teaching courses, advising students, and evaluating student performance through grades and assessments.
3. Course Management
Courses are defined with a course ID, name, description, credits, and semester offered.
Each course is taught by one or more faculty members and is attended by a group of students.
The system tracks course schedules, assignments, exams, and final grades for students.
4. Department Management
The institution is divided into multiple departments (e.g., Computer Science, Mathematics), each with a department head who oversees faculty and academic activities.
Departments manage both students and faculty within their academic programs.
5. Reports and Monitoring
The system generates reports on student performance, faculty workload, course enrollments, and department statistics.
Academic administrators can monitor student progress, faculty assignments, and overall department performance.
