A customer arrives at a checkout with items to
purchase. The cashier uses the POS
system to record each purchased item.
The system presents a running total and
line-item details. The customer enters
payment information, which the system
validates and records. The system updates
inventory. The customer receives a receipt
from the system and then leaves with the
items.
