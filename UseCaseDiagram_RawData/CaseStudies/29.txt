This system is useful in the road transport and highways field (Ministry of Road Transport and 
Highways). Green rides is a technical solution for the general public to guide them to a less polluted path while travelling, to know about the traffic jam, identification of accident- prone spots, 
meals- on- wheel, the establishment of drive-mode applications. This app consists of a Google map 
view on the main screen. A user can select the source to destination path which then will be 
processed to give a number of routes to reach the destination from source with amount of traffic 
at various locations in that path along with current pollution status in that route (which updates 
overtime). If there exists a traffic jam, a user can blow a horn to all users within a specific radius. 
According to his current location in the form of a small notification which the persons in the specified radius will receive. The accidents that occurred at specific spots will be reported by the user 
to the concerned authority who will do the rescue operations and hence the accident- prone areas 
will be categorized based on the number of accidents taking place and a notification appears for 
the user to drive slow and safe when they are in that particular location. The road authority admin 
checks the system often. Meals- on- wheel provides information about hotels and restaurants which 
are available in the chosen route so that the user can place the order as per the available menu at 
a particular eating place including time of service so that one need not wait at the restaurant for 
placing the order. Drive- mode helps to minimize the risks of accidents while attending mobile 
phones during driving. This module would send an SMS to the caller that the particular person is 
driving when the geo- coordinates show the mobile shifting of the driver is beyond some specified 
speed limit (say, 20 kmph). Before start of the journey, this module can be turned on. The feedback feature allows the user to give feedbacks about the accuracy in the traffic and pollution levels 
in a given area
