The Eco-Friendly Shopping Guide is a mobile app designed to help environmentally-conscious consumers find and choose sustainable products nearby. The app offers a variety of features, including product listings, eco-certification details, user reviews, and rewards for making eco-friendly choices. By encouraging sustainable purchasing behaviors, the app supports a community of users who aim to reduce their environmental footprint.

Key features include Product Search and Filtering options, allowing users to find products that meet specific eco-certifications, such as "organic," "recyclable," or "locally sourced." Each product profile contains details like brand, certification status, and a sustainability rating based on user reviews and third-party certifications. Users can leave reviews on products theyâ€™ve purchased, helping to build a community rating system that guides others in making informed choices.

The app also has a Rewards System where users can earn points for purchasing eco-friendly items. These points can later be redeemed for discounts, eco-friendly products, or donations to environmental causes. Additionally, the app tracks users' purchasing history and calculates their environmental impact, providing a summary of their contributions over time.

With its community-driven approach, the Eco-Friendly Shopping Guide fosters a supportive environment where users can share tips, ask questions, and stay updated on new eco-friendly products and brands. By promoting transparency and rewarding sustainable choices, the app empowers users to make greener lifestyle choices with ease.
