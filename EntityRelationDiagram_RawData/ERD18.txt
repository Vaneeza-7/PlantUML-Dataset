This system is designed to manage final year projects for students in a university, from project proposal submission to final evaluation. It involves tracking students, faculty members, project details, committees, and evaluations.

1. Student Management
Students submit their project proposals individually or in groups. Each student has a student ID, name, email, department, degree program, and year of study.
Each group consists of 2-4 students, and a group has a group ID and a leader. The system tracks which students belong to which group.
Students can submit project proposals, which include the proposal ID, title, description, submission date, and status (pending, approved, rejected).
2. Project Management
Each project has a project ID, title, description, start date, end date, and status (ongoing, completed, rejected).
A project is assigned to one or more supervisors. A supervisor is a faculty member who oversees the progress of the project. The system keeps track of supervisor ID, name, department, email, and designation.
A project may also involve external mentors from industry, recorded with details such as mentor ID, name, company, email, and role.
3. Committee Management
A project evaluation committee is formed to evaluate each project. Each committee is identified by a committee ID, and consists of faculty members from various departments.
A committee is responsible for the final project evaluation and can provide feedback or request changes to the project. The committee members are recorded with their committee role (chairperson, evaluator, observer), and the date of evaluation is tracked.
4. Project Evaluation
The system manages the evaluation of projects through progress reports and final evaluations.
Progress reports are submitted by students at different phases of the project (e.g., proposal phase, mid-term, final). Each report is recorded with a report ID, submission date, feedback, and status (approved, revisions required).
The final evaluation includes the committeeâ€™s feedback, overall score, and comments on the project. The score is broken down into individual components such as innovation, technical accuracy, and presentation.
5. Task and Milestone Management
The project timeline is divided into milestones. Each milestone is recorded with a milestone ID, name, due date, and status (completed, pending).
Each milestone has associated tasks for students, including task ID, task description, assigned group members, start date, end date, and completion status.
Supervisors can assign or approve tasks and track the progress of milestones and tasks through the system.
6. Document and Resource Management
The system allows students to upload relevant project documents such as proposals, progress reports, source code, and presentations. Each document is tagged with document ID, title, upload date, and file type.
The system stores resource requirements for the project, such as software, hardware, and budget. Each resource is tracked with a resource ID, name, quantity, and cost.
7. Reporting and Monitoring
The system generates reports on project statuses, student performance, and committee evaluations.
Supervisors and committees can view progress reports to monitor student progress at different stages of the project.
The system alerts students and supervisors when deadlines for proposals, progress reports, or evaluations are approaching.
8. Grading and Results
After the final evaluation, the committee assigns grades to each project, broken down by components such as innovation, technical skills, teamwork, and presentation. These are stored with the evaluation ID, total score, and final grade.
The system tracks the grade history for each student, allowing supervisors to view performance trends across different projects.
