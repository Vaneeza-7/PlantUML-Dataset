The Personal Finance Tracker is a digital tool designed to empower users to take control of their financial health through budgeting, expense tracking, and goal setting. The system enables users to categorize expenses into various spending areas—such as groceries, entertainment, bills, and savings—providing a clear snapshot of where their money goes each month. Users can set up monthly budgets and receive alerts when approaching or exceeding limits in specific categories, helping them to make more mindful spending decisions. With real-time expense logging, the app keeps track of every transaction, offering a dynamic overview of income versus spending.

In addition to managing daily finances, the system includes tools for long-term financial planning. Users can set personal savings goals for milestones like vacations, home purchases, or emergency funds, and monitor their progress over time. Visualizations, such as pie charts and trend graphs, help users quickly grasp spending patterns and assess their financial health. By offering insights into both short- and long-term financial habits, the Personal Finance Tracker not only promotes better financial decision-making but also fosters sustainable budgeting practices to help users meet their financial aspirations.
