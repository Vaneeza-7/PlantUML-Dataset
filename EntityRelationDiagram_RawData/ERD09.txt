The Georgia Tech Library (GTL) database system is designed to manage members, books, borrowing activities, and the catalog effectively. The library serves approximately 16,000 members and holds 100,000 titles with 250,000 volumes (averaging 2.5 copies per book). About 10% of the books are on loan at any time. The system ensures librarians can track book availability, including how many copies are in the library or out on loan.

An online catalog organizes books by author, title, and subject area, with detailed descriptions accessible for reference. Each book is uniquely identified by its International Standard Book Number (ISBN), allowing differentiation between editions or bindings of the same title. Certain books, like rare items, maps, or reference materials, are non-lendable and tracked separately. The database also keeps a wishlist of books that librarians aim to acquire, such as rare or out-of-print editions.

Members can borrow up to five books for 21 days, with a one-week grace period before reminders are sent. Faculty members, considered automatic members, have extended borrowing privileges, allowing three-month loans with a two-week grace period. Membership requires an application, including personal details like SSN, addresses, and phone numbers. Each member receives a card valid for four years, with renewal notices sent a month before expiry. Faculty member data is auto-integrated from employee records, and cards are sent to their campus address.

The system also identifies active and inactive members based on borrowing behavior. It tracks top borrowers, ensuring data on borrowing trends is available. Approximately 5% of members receive reminders to return overdue books, and a similar percentage of overdue books are lost or unreturned.

The database differentiates between lendable and non-lendable books, tracks borrowing history, and keeps data on books of interest for acquisition. It manages the librarian roles, including chief librarian, reference librarians, check-out staff, and assistants, to streamline library operations efficiently.
