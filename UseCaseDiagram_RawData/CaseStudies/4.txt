Citizens in every district face the difficulty with the of government certificates like birth/death certificates, income and caste certificates, old age and widow pensions, etc. This can be done with e-Province. This case study demonstrates how to make the government services available to the citizens in a convenient, efficient, and transparent manner, by enabling it simply by reliable access over the Internet. The main objective is to bring the public services closer to the citizens. To fulfill the vision of providing an easy and convenient service to the citizens through remote access primarily through Common Service Centre (CSCs), the e-Province project is created. This case study aims to develop a State Portal (SP) to provide all the citizens of the respective province to access the services under a single interface mechanism in the form of the Portal.
The various modules in the e-Province project are an Admin module that creates, updates, deactivates the users and performs various other tasks. A Login module that allows the users to login with their unique Application number with approved status. A User module that allows the approved users to register for the respective certificates. A User Profile module that creates the pre-requisite information of the user that needs to be stored in the database. The Certificate module contains the required forms that are to be filled with the information of the users.
