Design a database to keep track of information for an art museum. Assume 
that the following requirements were collected:
 ■ The museum has a collection of ART_OBJECTS. Each ART_OBJECT has a 
unique Id_no, an Artist (if known), a Year (when it was created, if known), 
a Title, and a Description. The art objects are categorized in several ways, as 
discussed below.
 ■ ART_OBJECTS are categorized based on their type. There are three main 
types—PAINTING, SCULPTURE, and STATUE—plus another type called 
OTHER to accommodate objects that do not fall into one of the three main 
types.
 ■ A PAINTING has a Paint_type (oil, watercolor, etc.), material on which 
it is Drawn_on (paper, canvas, wood, etc.), and Style (modern, 
abstract, etc.).
 ■ A SCULPTURE or a statue has a Material from which it was created (wood, 
stone, etc.), Height, Weight, and Style.
 ■ An art object in the OTHER category has a Type (print, photo, etc.) and Style.
 ■ ART_OBJECTs are categorized as either PERMANENT_COLLECTION 
(objects that are owned by the museum) and BORROWED. Information 
captured about objects in the PERMANENT_COLLECTION includes  
Date_acquired, Status (on display, on loan, or stored), and Cost. Information 
 captured about BORROWED objects includes the Collection from which it 
was borrowed, Date_borrowed, and Date_returned.
 ■ Information describing the country or culture of Origin (Italian, Egyptian, 
American, Indian, and so forth) and Epoch (Renaissance, Modern, 
Ancient, and so forth) is captured for each ART_OBJECT.
 ■ The museum keeps track of ARTIST information, if known: Name,  
DateBorn (if known), Date_died (if not living), Country_of_origin, Epoch, 
Main_style, and Description. The Name is assumed to be unique.
 ■ Different EXHIBITIONS occur, each having a Name, Start_date, and End_date. 
EXHIBITIONS are related to all the art objects that were on display during 
the exhibition.
 ■ Information is kept on other COLLECTIONS with which the museum 
interacts; this information includes Name (unique), Type (museum, per
sonal, etc.), Description, Address, Phone, and current Contact_person.
