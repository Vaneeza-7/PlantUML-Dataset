 an EER diagram for a small-private-airport 
database; the database is used to keep track of airplanes, their owners, air
port employees, and pilots. From the requirements for this database, the fol
lowing information was collected: Each AIRPLANE has a registration number 
[Reg#], is of a particular plane type [OF_TYPE], and is stored in a particular 
hangar [STORED_IN]. Each PLANE_TYPE has a model number [Model], a 
capacity [Capacity], and a weight [Weight]. Each HANGAR has a number  
[Number], a capacity [Capacity], and a location [Location]. The database also 
keeps track of the OWNERs of each plane [OWNS] and the EMPLOYEEs who 
have maintained the plane [MAINTAIN]. Each relationship instance in OWNS 
relates an AIRPLANE to an OWNER and includes the purchase date [Pdate]. 
Each relationship instance in MAINTAIN relates an EMPLOYEE to a service 
record [SERVICE]. Each plane undergoes service many times; hence, it is 
related by [PLANE_SERVICE] to a number of SERVICE records. A SERVICE 
record includes as attributes the date of maintenance [Date], the number of 
hours spent on the work [Hours], and the type of work done [Work_code]. We 
use a weak entity type [SERVICE] to represent airplane service, because the 
airplane registration number is used to identify a service record. An OWNER 
is either a person or a corporation. Hence, we use a union type (category) 
[OWNER] that is a subset of the union of corporation [CORPORATION] and 
person [PERSON] entity types. Both pilots [PILOT] and employees 
[EMPLOYEE] are subclasses of PERSON. Each PILOT has specific attributes 
license number [Lic_num] and restrictions [Restr]; each EMPLOYEE has spe
cific attributes salary [Salary] and shift worked [Shift]. All PERSON entities in 
the database have data kept on their Social Security number [Ssn], name 
[Name], address [Address], and telephone number [Phone]. For CORPORATION 
entities, the data kept includes name [Name], address [Address], and  
telephone number [Phone]. The database also keeps track of the types of 
 planes each pilot is authorized to fly [FLIES] and the types of planes each 
employee can do maintenance work on [WORKS_ON].
