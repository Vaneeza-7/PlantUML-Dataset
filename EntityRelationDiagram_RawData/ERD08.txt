The following narrative describes a simplified version of the organization of 
Olympic facilities planned for the summer Olympics. Draw an EER diagram 
that shows the entity types, attributes, relationships, and specializations for 
this application. State any assumptions you make. The Olympic facilities are 
divided into sports complexes. Sports complexes are divided into one-sport 
and multisport types. Multisport complexes have areas of the complex desig
nated for each sport with a location indicator (e.g., center, NE corner, and so 
 on). A complex has a location, chief organizing individual, total occupied 
area, and so on. Each complex holds a series of events (e.g., the track sta
dium may hold many different races). For each event there is a planned date, 
duration, number of participants, number of officials, and so on. A roster of 
all officials will be maintained together with the list of events each official 
will be involved in. Different equipment is needed for the events (e.g., goal 
posts, poles, parallel bars) as well as for maintenance. The two types of facil
ities (one-sport and multisport) will have different types of information. For 
each type, the number of facilities needed is kept, together with an approxi
mate budget.
