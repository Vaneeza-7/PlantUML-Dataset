e-Med is your perfect medical friend. We often see our grandparents forgetting to take their 
medicines or getting tensed when they run out of medical supplies. In this fast-paced world with 
unhealthy lifestyles, a number of young people also have some medical issues. e-Med is a tool that 
helps keep track of and address all your personal medical needs. Once the data is fed regarding 
the schedule of intake of medicines, this tool will provide reminders for taking the medicines. It 
will also send notifications to restock the medicines. It is also programmed to schedule monthly 
or yearly appointments regularly with the family doctor. Another interesting feature of this tool is 
that during critical situations, pressing the emergency button will automatically contact your near 
and dear ones whose contacts are in your emergency contact list. The tool helps in keeping a record 
of your medical history such as your blood sugar levels, pressure levels, etc. by using the Medical 
Notes feature. e-Med is an indispensable tool for people of all ages with medical issues to help 
maintain a good health routine
