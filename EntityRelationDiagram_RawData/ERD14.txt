Consider an ONLINE_AUCTION database system in which members (buyers 
and sellers) participate in the sale of items. The data requirements for this 
system are summarized as follows:
 ■ The online site has members, each of whom is identified by a unique 
member number and is described by an e-mail address, name, password, 
home address, and phone number.
 ■ A member may be a buyer or a seller. A buyer has a shipping address 
recorded in the database. A seller has a bank account number and routing 
number recorded in the database.
 ■ Items are placed by a seller for sale and are identified by a unique item 
number assigned by the system. Items are also described by an item title, 
a description, starting bid price, bidding increment, the start date of the 
auction, and the end date of the auction.
 ■ Items are also categorized based on a fixed classification hierarchy (for 
example, a modem may be classified as COMPUTER → HARDWARE → 
MODEM).
 ■ Buyers make bids for items they are interested in. Bid price and time of 
bid are recorded. The bidder at the end of the auction with the highest bid 
price is declared the winner, and a transaction between buyer and seller 
may then proceed.
 ■ The buyer and seller may record feedback regarding their completed 
transactions. Feedback contains a rating of the other party participating 
in the transaction (1–10) and a comment.
