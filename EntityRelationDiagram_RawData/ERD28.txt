The Snack and Grocery Shop Management System streamlines operations for retail stores that sell snacks, beverages, and grocery items. It handles inventory, sales, customer orders, supplier relations, and financial management to ensure efficient store operations.

Product and Inventory Management:
Each product is registered with a product ID, name, brand, category (snacks, groceries, beverages), price, stock quantity, and expiration date for perishables. The system tracks stock levels and alerts managers about low inventory or expiring items. Automatic restocking can be configured by setting reorder levels, generating purchase orders for suppliers, and updating inventory upon delivery.

Sales and Order Management:
In-store purchases are processed through a point-of-sale (POS) system, recording details such as products sold, payment method, and receipt. For online orders, customers can choose delivery or in-store pickup, with order tracking to ensure timely processing. The system stores order IDs, customer details, and transaction data, supporting loyalty rewards for repeat customers.

Supplier and Customer Management:
Supplier information, including ID, contact details, and products supplied, is maintained. Purchase orders track ordered items, quantities, delivery status, and costs. Customer profiles store IDs, contact details, and order history, enabling personalized promotions and loyalty program management. Customers earn points redeemable for discounts based on their purchase habits.

Reporting, Analytics, and Promotions:
Detailed sales reports cover performance trends, top-selling items, and low performers. Analytics on seasonal demand and profit margins guide inventory and pricing strategies. The system supports creating and tracking time-based discounts and promotions, enhancing customer engagement and driving sales.

Financial and Payment Management:
The system supports various payment methods, ensuring smooth transactions and tracking revenue, expenses, and profits. Refunds and exchanges are managed seamlessly, updating inventory and customer records. Financial reports help store owners make informed decisions for efficient financial management.

This comprehensive system enhances store productivity, improves customer satisfaction, and optimizes inventory and sales strategies.
