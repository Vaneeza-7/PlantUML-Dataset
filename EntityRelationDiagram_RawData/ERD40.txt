The Online Hair Salon System is designed to streamline appointment scheduling, service management, and client engagement for a hair salon. This system enables clients to browse available services, select preferred stylists, and book appointments online. Core functionalities include:

Client Management: Stores client profiles, tracking contact details, service history, and preferences to support personalized service and targeted promotions.

Service Catalog: Lists all available services (e.g., haircuts, coloring, styling) with details on pricing, duration, and stylist expertise, enabling clients to select services that match their needs.

Appointment Scheduling: Allows clients to view available time slots, select a preferred date and time, and receive booking confirmations. Staff members can also manage their schedules, view upcoming appointments, and reschedule as needed.

Payments and Billing: Integrates with online payment options, enabling clients to prepay or settle bills digitally, with automated billing and receipt generation.

Feedback and Reviews: Clients can leave feedback and rate services, helping the salon enhance quality and service offerings.

This online system optimizes the salonâ€™s operations by reducing manual scheduling and enhancing client convenience, leading to improved client satisfaction and better resource management for the salon.
