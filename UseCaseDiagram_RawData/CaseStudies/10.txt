Most of the car owners do not know whether their car is at risk and needs to be serviced. This 
considerably increases the risk of malfunctioning of major parts of a car such as the braking system 
and engine which lead to accidents.
Car Care is a multi-brand car service and maintenance application that maintains the date at 
which the specific part of a car is installed and notifies the expiry date of the parts of the car for 
both the driver and authorized service centre, so that the car can be serviced.
This application enables car owners and service centres to separately login and enter their cars 
information. After issuing the car, the service centre employee enters the estimated expiry dates of 
parts of the car in this app.
This application notifies the car owners and service centres when the expiry date for parts of 
the car is reached. Then the service centre employee contacts the owner of a car about service, once 
the owner accepts service request, the service centre employee picks up the car from home, this 
saves the time for owner of car.
And then service centre employee examines the entire car and prepares the list of the damaged parts of the car and send it to the owner of the car through this app, once the owner selects 
the damaged parts to be serviced, the employee services the owner selected parts and updates 
the information about changed parts in the app so that the car can be service again on the 
expiry date of changed parts. Thus, this application helps in exchanging information between 
car owners and service centres. This application also enables the online payment for the services
