Public Distribution System (PDS) is an Indian food security system. It is established by the 
Government of India under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution and 
managed jointly with state governments in India. The traditional PDS is used to distribute grocery 
items to India’s poor who are valid ration cardholders. The validity and the allocation of the ration 
cards are monitored by the state governments. A ration cardholder should be given 35 kg of food 
grain as per the norms of PDS. However, there are concerns about the efficiency of the distribution 
process. In order to make it efficient and improve the current system of PDS, we are implementing 
e-Ration Shop. Here, we are going to make a website for shopping purposes. Using this website 
ration cardholder can order his/her grocery items from the PDS online. The main reason for using 
this website is to make this process computerized and to remove the drawbacks of the present way 
of issuing products based on the ration card. The main drawback in the current system is that 
the PDS has been criticized for its urban bias and its failure to serve the poorer sections of the 
population effectively. Also, many retail shopkeepers have a large number of bogus cards to sell 
food grains in the open market. Many PDS dealers resort to malpractice since they acquire less 
Salary so, by this project we are solving this problem too. Most of the time, users do not get their 
rightful entitlement in terms of quantity. What’s meant for them or the farm produce procured by 
the PDS is diverted to the open market. So in order to avoid all these drawbacks, we are going to 
use the e-Ration Shop which will help us to avoid the corruption in PDS if not eradicate it. The 
various importance of the proposed case study is every shop’s geo-location will be located on the 
map, all the information regarding shop and shopkeeper respective to the ration card and region, 
shop opening and closing details will be available, stock provided based on category, retailers can 
add, edit, delete and update their shop’s other items also, retailers can advertise their shops, stock 
availability will be notified on regular basis, product delivery feature, complaint forum for complaints by users, easy payment system by PayTM, COD etc., admin and moderator features for 
government and shopkeepers and authentication system by Aadhaar number and One-Time Pin 
(OTP).
