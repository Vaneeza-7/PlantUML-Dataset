The system manages patients, doctors, staff, and medical resources within a hospital.

1. Patient Management
Patients are registered with details like patient ID, name, date of birth, contact information, and medical history.
The system tracks appointments, diagnoses, treatments, and prescriptions for each patient.
Patients may be inpatients (admitted) or outpatients, and the system records their admission details (room, ward, doctor assigned) and discharge summaries.
2. Doctor Management
Doctors are identified by doctor ID, name, specialization, contact details, and availability.
Doctors are responsible for diagnosing and treating patients. The system tracks patient-doctor assignments and records the treatment plans and prescriptions provided by each doctor.
Doctors may also perform surgeries, and the system tracks the schedule and surgery details.
3. Staff Management
Other hospital staff members, such as nurses, technicians, and administrative staff, are managed with staff ID, name, role, department, and shift schedules.
Staff are assigned to various tasks, such as assisting in patient care, performing tests, or managing administrative duties.
4. Appointment and Scheduling
Patients can schedule appointments with doctors, which are recorded with appointment ID, date, time, and doctor assigned.
The system also manages the doctorâ€™s schedule to avoid conflicts and ensure proper patient care.
5. Treatment and Billing
The system records treatment plans, including medications, tests, and procedures prescribed by doctors.
The billing module generates invoices for treatments, medications, and services provided. Each invoice contains details like billing ID, date, amount, and payment status.
6. Medical Records and Reports
The hospital maintains medical records for each patient, including their treatment history, lab results, and diagnostic reports.
The system generates reports on patient admissions, treatment outcomes, and resource utilization within the hospital.
