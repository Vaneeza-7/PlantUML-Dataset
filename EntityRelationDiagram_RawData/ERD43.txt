The Tour City Food Recommendation System is designed to help travelers discover the best dining spots based on local cuisines, popular dishes, and user preferences in various tourist cities. The system provides personalized food and restaurant recommendations, allowing users to explore authentic dining experiences across destinations.

City and Cuisine Profiles: Each city has a curated profile highlighting its unique culinary specialties, popular dishes, food markets, and notable dining areas, enabling users to get a quick overview of must-try foods in each destination.

Restaurant Recommendations: Based on city location, users receive recommendations for top-rated restaurants, street food vendors, or hidden local gems. Filters allow users to refine choices based on budget, cuisine type, or meal setting (e.g., fine dining, casual eateries, or street food).

User Preferences and Reviews: The system tailors recommendations by considering user preferences, dietary restrictions, and past reviews or ratings. Users can rate and review restaurants, helping others discover quality spots and build a community-driven guide.

Must-Try Dishes and Pairings: Each cityâ€™s recommendations include signature dishes, popular food pairings, and suggested beverage options, making it easy for travelers to sample local flavors authentically.

Itinerary Integration: Users can add dining spots to their travel itinerary, set reminders for meal times, and get directions to the location. The system can also suggest meal options near tourist attractions for convenient dining.

With this system, travelers can navigate local dining scenes, find hidden gems, and enjoy culturally immersive food experiences, enriching their visit to each city.
