A database is being constructed to keep track of the teams and games of a 
sports league. A team has a number of players, not all of whom participate in 
each game. It is desired to keep track of the players participating in each 
game for each team, the positions they played in that game, and the result of the game. Design an ER schema diagram for this application, stating any 
assumptions you make. Choose your favorite sport (e.g., soccer, baseball, 
football).
