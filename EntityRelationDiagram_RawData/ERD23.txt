The mobile application allows users to create, organize, and manage personal notes. Each user registers with a unique account and can create multiple notes, each containing a title, content, and optional tags for categorization. Notes are saved with creation and last modified dates, and users can organize them into folders for better structure. The app supports features like search, sorting (by date, title), and pinning important notes for quick access.

Additionally, users can set reminders for specific notes, and the app sends notifications when these reminders are due. The app may also support syncing across devices, allowing users to access their notes from multiple platforms. Users can also backup their data to the cloud, ensuring that notes are not lost. The system tracks user activity, such as note creation and edits, and provides a recycle bin for deleted notes that can be restored within a specific time period.
