About 10% of the volumes are out on loan at any one time. The librarians ensure that the books that members want to borrow are available when the members want to borrow them. Also, the librarians must know how many copies of each book are in the library or out on loan at any given time. A catalog of books is available online that lists books by author, title, and subject area. For each title in the library, a book description is kept in the catalog; the description ranges from one sentence to several pages. The reference librarians want to be able to access this description when members request information about a book. Library staff includes chief librarian, departmental associate librarians, reference librarians, check-out staff, and library assistants. Books can be checked out for 21 days. Members are allowed to have only five books out at a time. Members usually return books within three to four weeks. Most members know that they have one week of grace before a notice is sent to them, so they try to return books before the grace period ends. About 5% of the members have to be sent reminders to return books. Most overdue books are returned within a month of the due date. Approximately 5% of the overdue books are either kept or never returned. The most active members of the library are defined as those who borrow books at least ten times during the year. The top 1% of membership does 15% of the borrowing, and the top 10% of the membership does 40% of the borrowing. About 20% of the members are totally inactive in that they are members who never borrow. To become a member of the library, applicants fill out a form including their SSN, campus and home mailing addresses, and phone numbers. The librarians issue a numbered, machine-readable card with the member’s photo on it. This card is good for four years. A month before a card expires, a notice is sent to a member for renewal. Professors at the institute are considered automatic members. When a new faculty member joins the institute, his or her information is pulled from the employee records and a library card is mailed to his or her campus address. Professors are allowed to check out books for three-month intervals and have a two-week grace period. Renewal notices to professors are sent to their campus address. The library does not lend some books, such as reference books, rare books, and maps. The librarians must differentiate between books that can be lent and those that cannot be lent. In addition, the librarians have a list of some books they are interested in acquiring but cannot obtain, such as rare or out-of-print books and books that were lost or destroyed but have not been replaced. The librarians must have a system that keeps track of books that cannot be lent as well as books that they are interested in acquiring. Some books may have the same title; therefore, the title cannot be used as a means of identification. Every book is identified by its International Standard Book Number (ISBN), a unique international code assigned to all books. Two books with the same title can have different ISBNs if they are in different languages or have different bindings (hardcover or softcover). Editions of the same book have different ISBNs. The proposed database system must be designed to keep track of the members, the books, the catalog, and the borrowing activity.",

Each PLANE_TYPE has a model number [Model], a capacity [Capacity], and a weight [Weight]. 4. Each HANGAR has a number [Number], a capacity [Capacity], and a location [Location]. 5. The database also keeps track of the OWNERs of each plane [OWNS] and the EMPLOYEEs who have maintained the plane [MAINTAIN]. 6. Each relationship instance in OWNS relates an AIRPLANE to an OWNER and includes the purchase date [Pdate]. 7. Each relationship instance in MAINTAIN relates an EMPLOYEE to a service record [SERVICE]. 8. Each plane undergoes service many times; hence, it is related by [PLANE_SERVICE] to a number of SERVICE records. 9. A SERVICE record includes as attributes the date of maintenance [Date], the number of hours spent on the work [Hours], and the type of work done [Work_code]. 10. We use a weak entity type [SERVICE] to represent airplane service, because the airplane registration number is used to identify a service record. 11. An OWNER is either a person or a corporation. Hence, we use a union type (category) [OWNER] that is a subset of the union of corporation [CORPORATION] and person [PERSON] entity types. 12. Both pilots [PILOT] and employees [EMPLOYEE] are subclasses of PERSON. 13. Each PILOT has specific attributes license number [Lic_num] and restrictions [Restr]; each EMPLOYEE has specific attributes salary [Salary] and shift worked [Shift]. 14. All PERSON entities in the database have data kept on their Social Security number [Ssn], name [Name], address [Address], and telephone number [Phone]. 15. For CORPORATION entities, the data kept includes name [Name], address [Address], and telephone number [Phone]. 16. The database also keeps track of the types of planes each pilot is authorized to fly [FLIES] and the types of planes each employee can do maintenance work on [WORKS_ON].",

Student Registration and Allocation Students register for the hostel by filling out an application form that includes their student ID, name, contact details, department, year of study, and gender. Each student is assigned a room based on availability. Rooms are categorized by room number, block, floor, capacity, and type (single, double, triple occupancy). A student can occupy only one room at a time, and multiple students may share the same room if it has more than one bed. Once a room is allocated, the system stores the date of allocation and generates a room assignment ID to track the occupancy history. 2. Room Management Each room belongs to a block within the hostel (e.g., Block A, Block B). The system maintains the status of rooms, indicating whether a room is vacant, occupied, or under maintenance. There are staff members assigned to manage room maintenance requests. These staff members are identified by their staff ID, name, role, and contact information. 3. Fees and Payment Tracking Students are charged a monthly fee based on the room type they are assigned. The fee details include the amount, due date, and payment status (paid, pending, overdue). Students can make payments for the hostel fees through the system. Each payment is recorded with a payment ID, payment date, amount paid, and the method of payment (cash, card, online transfer). The system should also track any penalties for late payments and generate invoices for students. 4. Visitor Management The hostel management system allows students to register visitors. Visitors are recorded with visitor ID, name, contact details, and the date and time of their visit. A visitor must be assigned to a specific student, and their entry and exit are recorded for security purposes. 5. Complaint and Maintenance Tracking Students can file complaints regarding room maintenance or other issues through the system. Each complaint is assigned a complaint ID, description, date filed, and status (open, in progress, resolved). Maintenance staff members are assigned to resolve these complaints, and the system tracks maintenance requests, including the staff assigned, completion date, and maintenance details. 6.

Employees are also tracked by their date of joining, salary, and availability (active, on leave, etc.). Employees can be assigned to multiple projects at the same time, but each project requires tracking the employee’s role on the project (developer, tester, manager, etc.). 2. Client Management The system maintains details about clients who provide the company with projects. Each client has a client ID, company name, contact person, email, and phone number. Clients can have multiple projects with the software house. Each project has an associated start date, end date, budget, and status (active, completed, on hold). A client can make payments to the software house for services provided. These payments are tracked with a payment ID, payment date, amount, and payment method (bank transfer, credit card, etc.). 3. Project Management Each project is given a project ID, name, description, and deadline. The system tracks the start date and end date of each project. Each project is divided into milestones. A milestone includes a milestone ID, description, start date, end date, and status (in progress, completed). A project can be assigned multiple employees, with each employee having a specific role (developer, manager, tester, etc.) in the project. The system records the hours worked by employees on each project. The system should also track the project budget, including cost of resources, payments made by clients, and any additional expenses. 4. Task Management Projects are broken down into tasks. Each task has a task ID, description, priority (low, medium, high), assigned employee, deadline, and status (pending, in progress, completed). Employees are responsible for completing tasks, and the system records time logs for each task, showing how long it took to complete. Tasks may also have dependencies, meaning some tasks can only begin once others are completed. 5.

It involves tracking students, faculty members, project details, committees, and evaluations. 1. Student Management Students submit their project proposals individually or in groups. Each student has a student ID, name, email, department, degree program, and year of study. Each group consists of 2-4 students, and a group has a group ID and a leader. The system tracks which students belong to which group. Students can submit project proposals, which include the proposal ID, title, description, submission date, and status (pending, approved, rejected). 2. Project Management Each project has a project ID, title, description, start date, end date, and status (ongoing, completed, rejected). A project is assigned to one or more supervisors. A supervisor is a faculty member who oversees the progress of the project. The system keeps track of supervisor ID, name, department, email, and designation. A project may also involve external mentors from industry, recorded with details such as mentor ID, name, company, email, and role. 3. Committee Management A project evaluation committee is formed to evaluate each project. Each committee is identified by a committee ID, and consists of faculty members from various departments. A committee is responsible for the final project evaluation and can provide feedback or request changes to the project. The committee members are recorded with their committee role (chairperson, evaluator, observer), and the date of evaluation is tracked. 4. Project Evaluation The system manages the evaluation of projects through progress reports and final evaluations. Progress reports are submitted by students at different phases of the project (e.g., proposal phase, mid-term, final). Each report is recorded with a report ID, submission date, feedback, and status (approved, revisions required). The final evaluation includes the committee’s feedback, overall score, and comments on the project. The score is broken down into individual components such as innovation, technical accuracy, and presentation. 5. Task and Milestone Management The project timeline is divided into milestones. Each milestone is recorded with a milestone ID, name, due date, and status (completed, pending). Each milestone has associated tasks for students, including task ID, task description, assigned group members, start date, end date, and completion status. Supervisors can assign or approve tasks and track the progress of milestones and tasks through the system. 6. Document and Resource Management The system allows students to upload relevant project documents such as proposals, progress reports, source code, and presentations. Each document is tagged with document ID, title, upload date, and file type. The system stores resource requirements for the project, such as software, hardware, and budget. Each resource is tracked with a resource ID, name, quantity, and cost. 7. Reporting and Monitoring The system generates reports on project statuses, student performance, and committee evaluations. Supervisors and committees can view progress reports to monitor student progress at different stages of the project. The system alerts students and supervisors when deadlines for proposals, progress reports, or evaluations are approaching. 8. Grading and Results After the final evaluation, the committee assigns grades to each project, broken down by components such as innovation, technical skills, teamwork, and presentation.
