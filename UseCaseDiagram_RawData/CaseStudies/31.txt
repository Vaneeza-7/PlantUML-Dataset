The students in our college have a lot of unnecessary goods lying around, whereas many other 
people might be benefitted from those things. So I would like to put forward a website that can be 
used to sell or trade the goods with someone who needs them. It proves to be extremely useful in 
cases like buying and trading second- hand books or study materials among students and faculties. 
Initially, the website can exclusively only be accessed by the students within the PSG Tech College 
campus. Later on, if expected demands are met, it shall be expanded to other colleges. The sellers 
are given special accounts in which they are rated based on their previous records with which the 
buyers can choose their seller
